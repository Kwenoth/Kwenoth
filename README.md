## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm studying frontend at Hexlet programming school and looking for a job as a Junior Frontend Developer.

I have a great desire to become a part of a friendly and professional team, where I could get a real "field" experience and grow as a specialist.

I am open to any suggestions!
